# Microchip IC Programming with PICKIT 4/5

This repository contains sample Java code to read the serial number of a PICKIT 4 or 5 programmer and program Microchip ICs.

## Features
- Read the serial number of the PICKIT 4 or 5.
- Program Microchip Integrated Circuits (ICs) using the PICKIT 4 or 5.

## Requirements

To run this code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **PICKIT 4 or 5 Programmer**.
- **Microchip ICs** (compatible ICs for programming).
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher.
- **MPLAB X IDE** (optional but recommended for easier integration).
- **MPLAB IPE** (Integrated Programming Environment) for standalone programming.
- Java libraries for interfacing with the PICKIT 4/5 and programming the ICs.

## Acknowledgments

- [Microchip Technology](https://www.microchip.com/) for providing the PICKIT 4/5 programmers and associated documentation.
- Open-source community for software libraries used in this project.
